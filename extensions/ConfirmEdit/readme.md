#Introduction
A special case CAPTCHA plugin for ConfirmEdit. Instead of presenting a CAPTCHA to solve when adding a new link to an external site, A simple message is displayed indicating that the edit will not be accepted.

#Todo
This plugin is really just a hack-job on FancyCaptcha.php and family. Given the it's limited functionality, it might be worthwhile to re-implement it as it's own MediaWiki extension. That way, we could still use ConfirmEdit for account creation CAPTCHAs.

#Requires
[ConfirmEdit](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit)
